# Prebuilt-MPR
This is the source for the code that powers the Prebuilt-MPR. Here lies the needed components that allow for continuous deployments of MPR packages to the Prebuilt-MPR APT repositories.

## The Prebuilt-MPR update flow
A few things happen from a package being upload to the MPR to the package making it to the Prebuilt-MPR's APT repositories. We'll use the [`docker-compose`](https://mpr.makedeb.org/packages/docker-compose) package as an example.

1. `docker-compose` gets updated on the MPR.
2. The Prebuilt-MPR [updater](/main.py) notices that the package is out of date, and creates a pull request to update the package's version in the Prebuilt-MPR.
3. The pull request gets merged, triggering a CI job to build and deploy the package.

And assuming all goes sound, you then get the new version of the package ready to be installed on your system!

## Security
Since you're downloading pre-compiled packages when using the Prebuilt-MPR, you run the risk of installing malware (and more so since there is no way to inspect source files like you could on the MPR).

The Prebuilt-MPR solves this by hosting a separate copy of each package in this repo on the `pkg/` branches. Since updates are done via pull requests, it allows a [makedeb Trusted User](https://docs.makedeb.org/support/makedeb-team) to review the build files before they get merged and deployed into the Prebuilt-MPR APT repository.

## Maintaining
This section is for use by maintainers of the Prebuilt-MPR. Normals users won't get much value out of this section, unless they plan on potentially joining the group of people who maintain the repository.

### Package updates
The main task of maintainers in the Prebuilt-MPR is to review pull requests for package updates and merge them as needed.

All user-provided files will be contained in the `pkg/` folder of each branch. All other files are generated and managed by the updater itself, so you're safe to not review them.

### Adding a new distribution
Adding a new distribution to the Prebuilt-MPR APT repositories entails the following:

1. Add the relevant entry in `templates/packages/.drone/drone.star` at the bottom of the file.

2. Update packaging scripts by running `CI_SKIP=1 scripts/update-templates.sh` from the root of the repository.

3. Rerun builds for all packages against the new distribution. This currently entails creating a new build run for each package manually, as certain packages depend on other Prebuilt-MPR packages (*TODO:* this needs to be automated in the future).

    3a. You can selectively run builds for a certain distribution by passing in the `distros` environment variable, which should contain a comma-separated list of distros to build for (i.e. `distros=jammy,bullseye`). With the Drone CLI tools, you can run the following (replace `{pkgbase}` with the package you're running the build for, and `{distro}` with the distribution to build for):
    ```sh
    drone build create makedeb/prebuilt-mpr --branch 'pkg/{pkgbase}' -p 'distros={distro}'
    ```
